# Grant's Wiki

I'm attempting to start something up like Andrew does
to keep track of different information that my brain thinks is important.

If it's not important to me, it shouldn't be here,
so this probably isn't something anyone else will contribute to.

## Usability

On my desktop, I have this repository cloned as `public` beside `private` etc.
I then open VS Code to the parent directory of that.

On mobile, I'm trying Spck Editor,
but the GitHub app also might work well enough for edits of existing files.

At some point, I may try to get an actual website generated from this stuff,
but source itself will have to do for now.
