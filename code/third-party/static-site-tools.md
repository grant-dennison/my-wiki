# Static Site Tools

I've looked some into static site generation tools, in part for hosting this wiki.

## Markdown Focus

My focus on site generators is specifically for Markdown right now.
A lot of site generators incorporate extra tools/languages for fancier features,
but I was mostly just trying to find something will render like I can get in VS Code.

* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is used by Rust and seems pretty simple
* [Slate](https://slatedocs.github.io/slate/) seems simple but it's pretty set on single page
* [Read the Docs](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) I think is like the OG one
