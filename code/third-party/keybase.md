# Keybase

Website: https://keybase.io

Overall assessment: Don't use.

* Support level: questionable
* Pricing model: none
* Owned by Zoom?

Keybase offers end-to-end-encrypted stuff, including chat, storage, and git repositories.
I don't trust it as sustainable though because there is no paid version,
and every user is apparently allowed 250GB of free storage?
