# Paint-Like JS Libs

I've spent some time looking into Paint-like applications that may be suitable
for integrating into the Maven web editor.

There are a lot of options out there, but most of them don't quite seem optimal.

Current favorite option: [Dotting](https://github.com/hunkim98/dotting).
It's pretty simple and claims to support mobile well.
Note that mobile didn't behave quite as I expected on simple try of website.

Previous favorite option (based on my own star in GitHub):

This guy had some other interesting stuff going on...
Also seemed to be a pretty complete yet still minimal interface.
Today it seems like maybe too much overkill. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
