# Proton

I've been thinking about trying out [Proton](https://proton.me)
as a drop-in replacement for Gmail etc. and also add a password manager in the mix.

Overall assessment: Probably a good option, but still maturing.

* Pricing: Reasonable
* Mail: Anecdotally seems to be big/reputable
  * Allows custom domains pretty easily
* Drive: Still pretty young, but could be good replacement for Google Drive. Client/API still immature.
  * Rclone has an early version of support for this as backend?
* Password manager: Also pretty new? Jordan likes it but said not yet as good as 1Password.
