# Password Managers

* [Password Safe](https://www.pwsafe.org)
  * Been using personally on local PC for many years
  * Originally from Bruce Schneier I think?
  * No mobile support
* [1Password](https://1password.com)
  * Industry leader
  * Seems pretty secure
  * Good cross-platform
  * Paid product
* [Proton Pass](https://proton.me/pass)
  * New kid on the block
  * Might be nice if I switch from Gmail to Proton Mail at some point
* Also made [my own](/public/code/projects/password-manager/index.md)
  * Simple
  * Not terribly user friendly
  * Not great for sharing or mobile
