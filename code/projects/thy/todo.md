# Thy TODO

Here's a list of some of the items I'd like to complete with Thy:

* Transform interpreter stack trace to reflect Thy source instead of interpreter internals
* Create basic Node.js runtime (CLI) for Thy source, powered by interpreter
* Go back to transpiler (maybe rewrite in Thy, fresh with tests?)
