# Thy TODO

Here's a list of some of the items I'd like to complete with Thy:

* Fix Firefox playground UI
  * Firefox exemplar trace parity with Chrome
  * Weird formatting (`at <anonymous>undefined<inline thy code>:9:3`) of stack frame in Chrome
  * Firefox doesn't show error message (not in `.stack`)
* Create basic Node.js runtime (CLI) for Thy source, powered by interpreter
* Go back to transpiler (maybe rewrite in Thy, fresh with tests?)
