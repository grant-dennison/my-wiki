# Thy TODO

Here's a list of some of the items I'd like to complete with Thy:

* Overhaul playground sharing
* Isn't there a bug with source mapping?
* Fix open/close nav bar on mobile
* Add table of contents with remark/rehype plugins remark-toc, rehype-slug, and rehype-autolink-headings
* Transform interpreter stack trace to reflect Thy source instead of interpreter internals
* Find better way to deal with CSS/HTML
* .thy/.txt toggle in playground
* Transition code-input to use React references (rather than a bunch of internal state)
* Create basic Node.js runtime (CLI) for Thy source, powered by interpreter
* `thy()` dependency resolution in playground
* Implement remaining standard library for interpreter
* Publish JSDocs of standard library
  * Seems like https://typedoc.org is probably the most standard tool here aside from JSDoc itself?
  * TS guru Gerrit0 seems to be involved: https://github.com/Gerrit0/typedoc-custom-theme-demo
* Publish Thy VS Code extension
* Go back to transpiler (maybe rewrite in Thy, fresh with tests?)
* Switch to refractor/react-refractor for faster (hopefully?) highlighting
* Input in playground?
* Line numbers in snippets on site? (this doesn't seem possible without either more complex HTML or JS)
